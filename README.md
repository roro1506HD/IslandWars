# IslandWars

Here is a mini-game I've developed a year ago, it requires a modified version of spigot which adds sereval custom events [available on the main class](https://github.com/roro1506HD/IslandWars/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/roro/islandwars/IslandWars.java#L42)

Some comments might be in French, and Javadoc is missing though I didn't find necessary to make one as it was a solo project.
